CHANGE LOG
3/14 and 3/18 - Created navbar by making the courses, faculty, activities, and contact tabs. Removed uneeded info. Added logo in the top left. Added contact inforation in the top header. Made the header fixed and transparent when scrolling. Changed the top background pictures and added ACL logo.

3/20 - Removal of unneeded sections on the home page and features such as buttons that were not needed. Changed color scheme and adjusted logo centering.

3/22 - Worked on different htmls that were links from the navbar. Everything changed in this day was removed because we decided to make our website 1 html.

3/25 - Added information to our website, changed the pictures in the background and added pictures where needed. Re-added a section to include teachers. Changed the navbar to link to places on the same page.

FUTURE ADDITIONS
-Learn more about the clubs in order to create a more detailed list, and remove some boxes in the activities section since we don't have that many clubs yet.
-Update the current event section to be actual events with current dates
----Above 2 would most likely just take 1 class at most----
-Make html files for teachers and clubs
----Above would most likely take 2 classes, also would need more information about the clubs and teachers to make----
